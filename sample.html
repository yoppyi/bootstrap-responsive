                                    <p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old gentleman rabbit, couldn't go to the owl teacher's school and tell the children about his travels on the day he had promised to do so. It was because his rheumatism was very bad, so the pupils, including Jacko and Jumpo
                                        Kinkytail, the red and green monkeys, were allowed to play a game instead of hearing a story. "Perhaps Uncle Wiggily will come tomorrow," said the teacher. And that is what the rabbit did, and he told how he had traveled many miles, and had had dozens and
                                        dozens of adventures, of which I have told you in the stories before this one. He also told how Jacko Kinkytail had been with him part of the time. "Oh, my, I wish I had been along," said Sammie Littletail to Jacko after school was over.</p>

                                    <p>It was about three days and a half after the adventure with the alligator, when Jacko Kinkytail had scared the skillery-scalery creature by bursting the paper bag, and the two monkey brothers were coming home from school in the afternoon. "Did you miss any
                                        of your lessons today?" asked Jacko, as he twined his tail around a hickory nut on the ground, and picked it up so he could eat it—eat the nut, not the ground, you understand, of course. "I missed one example," answered Jumpo, "but it was very hard." "What was
                                        it?" inquired Jacko, as he cracked the hickory nut in his strong teeth. "It was this," spoke his brother: "If a boy has a chocolate ice cream cone, and his sister has two, how many oranges can you buy for a bag of peanuts when a stick of peppermint candy
                                        breaks in three pieces and one of them falls inside a lemon? Don't you think that's a hard example, Jacko?"</p>

                                    <p>One day when the owl school teacher had heard the lessons of all her animal boy and girl pupils, she said: "You have been so good today that I am going to give you a little treat. Now, I will let Susie Littletail decide on what would be the nicest to do,
                                        have Uncle Wiggily Longears come over and tell you a story about his travels, or go for a walk in the woods and see if the chestnuts are ripe? Which shall it be, Susie?" "If you please," said the little rabbit girl. "I think it would be nice to go in the
                                        woods. Uncle Wiggily can tell us a story any time after dark, but we can't see to gather chestnuts at night. Let's go to the woods." "Very well," said the teacher. "Put away your books, pencils and papers and we will take a walk."</p>

                                    <p>It was a rainy Saturday, and if there is anything worse than that I'd like to know it. You see you don't have to go to school, and you have all day to play, but when it rains—why, what can you do? Just answer me that, if you please. Ha! I knew you couldn't.
                                        Well, that's exactly how it was with Jacko and Jumpo Kinkytail, as they stood at the window of the little house up in the tree and looked at the rain drops splashing against the glass. "Oh, dear!" cried Jumpo. "Oh, dear!" groaned Jacko. "Oh, my!" exclaimed
                                        their mamma. "What poor, miserable little monkey boys you are to be sure!" "But there isn't anything to do," grumbled the red monkey. "And we can't go out because it is raining too hard," added the green monkey.</p>

                        <p>"Well, what shall we do today?" asked Jumpo of his brother, as the two monkey boys slid down out of the tree-house one Saturday morning. "We don't have to go to school," spoke Jacko, "and I'm glad of it. Suppose we play soldier. I'll let you shoot me, if you don't do
                            it too hard." "All right. Oh, I tell you what let's do!" and Jumpo was so excited that he tied his tail in three hard knots and he could hardly get them out again. "What shall we do?" asked his brother, as he kindly helped untie the knots in Jumpo's tail. "We'll get a lot
                            of the fellows, and have a regular battle," proposed Jumpo. "We'll get Sammy Littletail and the two Bushytail brothers, and Buddy Pigg, and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow, and Jimmy Wibblewobble and Billie Wagtail, the goat, and all the others, including Munchie Trot, and
                            we'll choose sides and have a big fight. One side can be Indians, and the other white men." "Fine! Fine!" cried Jacko. "You go get the fellows, and I'll whittle out the make-believe wooden guns." Off Jumpo started, and it wasn't long before he had met a lot of his boy
                            friends. Of course they thought it was great fun to play soldier, and they hurried back with him. By this time Jacko had a lot of guns made, and then the boys divided into two parties. Jacko was captain of one side, and he and his friends were to pretend to be white
                            soldiers, and the others, of which Jumpo was captain, were to be the Indians.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">

                        </div>
                        <p class="lead">"Sure," said Billie Wagtail, shaking his horns. Pretty soon there was a rustling in the bushes, and along crept the make-believe Indians, softly and silently. Then, when they saw the cabin, Jumpo cried: "Fire! Fire! Shoot 'em! Bang! Bang! Capture 'em!" Up
                            jumped Jacko and his men. "Bangity-bang-bang!" cried Jacko. "Shoot 'em fellows! Fire like anything! Don't let 'em take us!" Well, I just wish you could have heard that racket! No, on second thought perhaps it's just as well you didn't, for it might have made you deaf to
                            hear so many guns going off at once. Oh, it was a fierce fight! if you will excuse me saying so. And after a while the Indians won, and into the cabin they rushed. "Escape! Get away fellows," cried brave monkey boy Jacko. "I'll keep them back until you get away." "That's
                            not fair!" shouted Sammie Littletail. "Yes it is," said Billie Wagtail. Well, Billie and the other white soldiers ran out the back door, while Jacko was shooting at the Indians at the front door, and so all the white soldiers got away except little red monkey, and he was
                            caught. "Now, we'll tie him to a tree, and we'll go off and try to catch the others," said Jumpo. So, in fun, they tied Jacko fast to a tree, and left him there in the woods by the make-believe cabin all alone, while they ran off shouting. "My! That was jolly sport,"</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>"Bang!" it went, just like a cannon. My! how loud! "Oh, I'm shot! I'm killed! My double-jointed tail is blown off!" cried the alligator, and then, half frightened to death, he scurried off through the woods, taking his tail with him, for of course it wasn't blown off
                            at all. So that's how the paper bag saved Jacko, and pretty soon his brother and the other Indians came back with their prisoners and the game was over. Then they untied Jacko and they all went to the home of the red and green monkeys, and Mrs. Kinkytail gave them all
                            some bread and jam. She spread thirty-three loaves of bread and used up seventeen pots of jam before they had enough, and the alligator didn't have a smitch, I'm glad to say. And the next story will be about Jumpo and the green parrot—that is, if the window pane doesn't
                            get the toothache in the night and cry like a baby so it wakes up the pussy cat. .</p>
